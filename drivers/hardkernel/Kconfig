	  Say Y here if you have a touchscreen interface using the
	  ADS7846/TSC2046/AD7873 or ADS7843/AD7843 controller,
	  and your board-specific setup code includes that in its
	  table of SPI devices.

	  If HWMON is selected, and the driver is told the reference voltage
	  on your board, you will also get hwmon interfaces for the voltage
	  (and on ads7846/tsc2046/ad7873, temperature) sensors of this chip.

	  If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ads7846.
